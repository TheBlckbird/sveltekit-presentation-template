# SvelteKit Presentation Template

This is my personal SvelteKit Presentation template based on [an article by Joy Of Code](https://joyofcode.xyz/beautiful-presentations-with-svelte).  
It uses [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/).

You put your slides into `src/routes/+page.svelte`. There are some examples to get you started.  
The [Reveal.js config](https://revealjs.com/config/) lies in `src/lib/deck/Presentation.svelte`.
